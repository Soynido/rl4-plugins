# RL4 — Claude Code Plugin

**Your AI forgets. RL4 doesn't.**

A persistent, proof-based memory layer for AI-native development. Context that follows you seamlessly across **Cursor, VS Code, and Claude Code CLI**.

## Why RL4?

Every time you switch editors, start a new chat, or come back to a project after a break — your AI starts from zero. No memory of what you built, why you made that decision, or what broke last time.

**RL4 fixes this.** It captures your development activity and makes it instantly available to any LLM, in any editor.

- No more re-explaining your architecture
- No more lost decisions and forgotten context
- No more "I don't have access to previous conversations"

## Install

In Claude Code CLI:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Soynido/rl4-plugins
claude plugin install rl4
```

Or from within a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add Soynido/rl4-plugins
/plugin install rl4
```

## Get Started

### 1. Authenticate

**Option A — You already use Cursor or VS Code with RL4:**

Credentials sync automatically via `~/.rl4/mcp.env`. Just make sure you've run `RL4: Connect` (Cmd+Shift+P) in your IDE. No extra setup needed.

**Option B — Claude Code standalone (no IDE):**

Go to [rl4.ai/dashboard/setup](https://rl4.ai/dashboard/setup), sign in, and follow the Claude Code instructions to configure your credentials.

### 2. Activate

```
/rl4
```

That's it. RL4 shows you an ASCII dashboard with your project stats and gives you full access to your development memory.

## What You Get

### Persistent Memory
Every chat, decision, file change, and commit — captured automatically and queryable instantly. Ask "What was I working on last week?" and get a cited answer.

### Cross-LLM Context Transfer
Switch from Cursor to Claude Code CLI to VS Code — your context follows. Zero re-setup. The same memory layer works everywhere.

### Proof-Based Answers
Every answer is backed by evidence. No hallucinations, no guesses — just facts from your actual development history, with sources cited.

### Smart Search (RAG)
Search across your entire development history with natural language. "What decisions did we make about auth?" returns relevant results with citations.

### Project Skills & Guardrails
Auto-generated DO/DON'T rules extracted from your real development activity. Your AI learns from your project's history, not generic patterns.

## Available Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/rl4` | Activate RL4 with ASCII dashboard |
| `rl4_ask("question")` | Get cited answers about your codebase |
| `search_context("query")` | Search all evidence with RAG |
| `get_evidence` | Full evidence pack |
| `get_timeline` | Project history journal |
| `get_decisions` | Decision log with confidence |
| `search_chats("query")` | Search chat history |
| `search_cli("query")` | Search CLI command history |

## Works With

| Editor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Cursor** | Full support via [RL4 Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rl4.rl4-snapshot-cursor) |
| **VS Code** | Full support via RL4 Extension |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Full support via this plugin |
| **Codex / Gemini** | MCP compatible |

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- Claude Code (latest version)
- RL4 account — [rl4.ai/dashboard/setup](https://rl4.ai/dashboard/setup)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin install fails

Make sure you've added the marketplace first:
```bash
claude plugin marketplace add Soynido/rl4-plugins
```

### MCP server won't start (ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND)

The plugin runs `setup.sh` during install to install npm dependencies. If deps are missing, re-run:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/installed/rl4/mcp-server && npm install
```

### Token expired (401 errors)

If you use Cursor/VS Code: run `RL4: Connect` (Cmd+Shift+P) then reload.

The MCP server reads credentials from `~/.rl4/mcp.env` (auto-generated by the IDE extension). Tokens refresh on each `RL4: Connect`.

### Local-only mode

RL4 works locally without authentication. Your `.rl4/` directory is always readable. Cloud features (list_workspaces, remote context) require auth.
